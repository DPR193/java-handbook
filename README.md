# Java Programming & DSA Handbook
This repository is a structured collection of notes, code examples, and problem-solving exercises focused on Java programming and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

It covers core Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming (OOP), and essential DSA topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, recursion, searching, and sorting. The content combines theoretical explanations with practical coding examples, organized by topic for easy navigation.

This is not a full course or tutorial series, but a comprehensive reference resource for learning Java and DSA.

## Setup Java Locally

### Install JDK

Download and install from [www.oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### Set JAVA Environment Variable

Follow this guide: [GeeksforGeeks – Setting Environment in Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/setting-environment-java/)

Verify:
```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

## Running Java Code (VS Code & CLI)

- Using VS Code
    - Install the **Java Extension Pack** from the Extensions tab.
    - Open your `.java` file.
    - Click "Run" or use shortcut `Ctrl` + `F5` to execute.

- Using Command Line
