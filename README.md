# Java Programming & DSA Learning Repository

> **ðŸŒŸ Star this repository if you find it useful!**

Welcome to my **Java Programming & DSA** learning repository. This is a collection of notes, code examples, and problem-solving exercises created while learning Java.
The repository covers core Java concepts, object-oriented programming, and common data structures and algorithms. It includes both theory and hands-on practice, organized topic-wise for easy reference.

This repository is not a full-fledged course or tutorial. Instead, itâ€™s a collection of my personal notes, code snippets, and problem-solving exercises created while learning Java and Data Structures & Algorithms.

[Navigate to the topics outlined below.](#table-of-contents)

## Setup Java Locally

### Install JDK

Download and install from [www.oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### Set JAVA Environment Variable

Follow this guide: [GeeksforGeeks â€“ Setting Environment in Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/setting-environment-java/)

Verify:
```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

## Running Java Code (VS Code & CLI)

- Using VS Code
    - Install the **Java Extension Pack** from the Extensions tab.
    - Open your `.java` file.
    - Click "Run" or use shortcut `Ctrl` + `F5` to execute.
- Using Command Line
    ```bash
    javac Main.java   # Compile
    java Main         # Run
    ```

## Repository Structure

- Each topic is organized into separate `folders/files` for clarity.
- File and folder names are chosen to match their respective topics for easy identification.
- Both notes (e.g. `README.md`) and practical code examples are included to support hands-on learning.
- Visual aids such as images or diagrams are stored in dedicated subfolders (e.g. `assets/`) where needed.
- Nested folders (e.g. `practice/`) are used to group related exercises or solutions within a topic.
